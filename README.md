# This Java simulation of Arithmetic operations show how the addition, subtraction, multiplication and division are implemented by hardware circuits.
# It also shows the speed of different operations
# Essentially, an integer adder consists of sequence of single-bit adders. A subtraction cirtcuit is made from flipping circuit and adders.
# A multiplication circuit is a sequence of copying, shifting circuits and adders
# A division circuit consists of many shifting, copying, adding and subtracting circuits
