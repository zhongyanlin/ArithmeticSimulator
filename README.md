# This Java simulation of Arithmetic operations show how the addition, subtraction, multiplication and division are implemented by hardware wiring.
# It also shows the speed of different operations
# Essentially, an integer adder consists of sequence of single-bit adder. Subtraction cirtcuit is made from flipping circuit and adder.
# Multiplication circuit is a sequence of copying, shifting circuits and adders
# Division circuit consists of many shifting, copying, adding and subtracting circuits
